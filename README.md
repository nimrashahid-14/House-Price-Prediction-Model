# House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains the dataset and code for a house price prediction model built using machine learning techniques. The model aims to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, size of the house, location, etc.

## Contents
- *dataset*: Contains the house price dataset used for training and testing the model.
- *House_Price_Prediction.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook with the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
- Model evaluation and comparison of different algorithms.
- Prediction of house prices using the trained model.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/nimrashahid-14/House-Price-Prediction-Model.git
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., using pip install -r requirements.txt if you have a requirements.txt file).
3. Open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and follow the steps to reproduce the results.

## Usage
Use this project as a reference or starting point for building your own house price prediction models. Feel free to explore the dataset, modify the code, and experiment with different machine learning techniques.
